readme - description of portable EAM potential package stored in portapot.tar
         Art Voter, 10/24/98. 
         Last changed 9/19/02 - now has all 7 fcc potentials, ni3-al3 and cu1-ag1
         and both the LA-UR document and the original MRS Voter-Chen paper 
         as pdf files. 
         [afv@lanl.gov, (505) 667-6198] 

A number of EAM potentials are included here in text 
format (indicated by the appended "t" on the file name).  
If you are setting up to use these potentials with one of 
my programs, you will want them in binary format.
My interpolation routines (trpsubs.f), which read the binary
versions, are included in this package.  The test programs below
may be helpful in seeing how to use routines.  (The esubs.f 
was written long ago, but I think it is still good.  The trpsubs.f
is my current version of the interpolation routines, as of 2/2000.)
If you are going to adapt your own code to use the interpolation
files, see the file-format information below.

Reference/Citation information is at the end of this file.

The potcong program converts potential files to or from 
binary format.  Thus, running it on the machine
where the potentials are to be installed will give
potentials in the correct binary format for that machine.  
The file potcong.dat contains the necessary commands to 
convert all the potentials.
Supply it as input to the potcong program.

After conversion to binary, the potential for, say, nickel, 
would be contained in the following files:
  ni.phi  - the pair potential  (hartree vs. angstroms)  
  ni.rho  - the density function   (density units vs. angstroms)
  ni.f    - the embedding function (hartree vs. density units)
  ni.doc  - text file with lattice const., mass, and other info.
(I use 27.21 eV/hartree as my standard conversion factor.)

You might then want to try the test programs below.

Installation Procedure:
-----------------------
1) Ideally, the package of files should be on a 
   subdirectory called  /.../pots

   % gunzip portapot.tar.gz  (you already did this to get to here)
   % tar xvf portapot.tar    (and this, too)

2) compile the standalone program called "potcong.f"

   % f77 potcong.f -o potcong      

3) run the potcong program, supplying input data:

   % potcong <potcong.dat          

4) If desired, the text versions of the files (e.g., ni.rhot, 
   ni.phit, ni.ft) can now be deleted, but this is not necessary.

Test Programs
-------------

There are two test programs.  They do not offer a comprehensive test, but
they will probably fail, or give outputs that differs from the included
test outputs, if the potential files are not properly installed.
I wrote them many years ago, but they still seem to do their simple tasks
correctly.


1)  etest - simple energy test on Ni-Al (ni3-al3) potential 
    to compile and link:   f77 etest.f esubs.f trpsubs.f -o etest
    to run:     etest >etest.lis
    to check:  compare etest.lis to etest.lis.ref

2)  etestcu - simple energy test on cu potential
    to compile and link:   f77 etestcu.f esubs.f trpsubs.f -o etestcu
    to run:     etestcu >etestcu.lis
    to check:  compare etestcu.lis to etestcu.lis.ref

Information about the file format if you are going to 
use these potentials in your own interpolation routines:
--------------------------------------------------------

   A given potential consists of four files.  For example, for copper,
they are
                    cu.doc  - information about the pot, atomic mass, lattice constant.
                    cu.phi  - phi(r) interpolation array
                    cu.rho  - rho(r) interpolation array
                    cu.f    - F(rhobar)  interpolation array

I usually use a binary format, so the text versions of the interpolation 
arrays are distinguished by a "t" at the end.
  
   Below is the text version of cu.phi (cu.phit), to demonstrate the format.
The .rho and .f files are the same format as this.  Given a potential 
interpolation file in this text format, you can run it through the potcong 
program if you want binary format.

First, the units:
-----------------
The .phi file is tabulated as hartree versus angstroms.  (use 1 h = 27.21 eV)
The .rho file is density units versus angstroms.  (doesnt matter what density units)
The .f file is hartree versus density units.


Now, the content of the file, which tabulates values of y for a range
of x.  Note (important) that the "zeroth" point (x0) and the last
point (xn) are given for the x range, whereas the y values are those
corresponding to x1 through xn.  I.e., there are n y values (y1,y2,...,yn), 
with no y0 value given.

line 1 [format(i10,3d20.12,2i5)]
------
  1) n
  2) x0
  3) xn
  4) float(n)/(xn-x0)
  5) iflo
  6) ifhi

lines 2 through end  [format(4d20.12)]
-------------------
  (y(i),i=1,n)

The iflo and ifhi parameters (integers) are simply flags to tell the
interp. routines what to do if the x values goes off the low or high
end of the range (iflo refers to the low end, ifhi refers to the high end)
 value
   0  -  set to zero if it goes off this end
   1  -  crash if it goes off this end
   2  -  extrapolate linearly if it goes off this end

References:
-----------
These potentials are described in a few different papers,
beginning with Ni and Al in Voter and Chen, 1987 [1].  
The most complete description of the fitting procedure is
in a chapter in a book on intermetallics [2].  This complete
description can also be found in a Los Alamos technical
report, along with the parameters for all seven fcc 
potentials [3].  This technical report and the original Voter-Chen 
paper are now included with this potentials package as pdf files.
For the "cu" potential, please cite Ref. [4],
which gives the parameters and cites the earlier papers
(or, cite both Ref. [4] and Ref. [2]).
For the silver potential ("ag"), please cite Refs. [5] and [2].
For Pd, Pt, and Au, simply cite reference [3], or check with me
for whether it has since been published in the regular literature.
The cu1 and ag1 potentials are designed to work with each other
for Cu-Ag alloy simulations.  The cross potential is simply fit
to the heat of solution at infinite dilution for Cu in Ag and Ag in Cu.
As pure elements (cu1, ag1), they work exactly like the cu and ag pots.
These will be described in a paper (Sprague et al) that we think will 
appear soon (writing this September of 2002) in Phys. Rev. B.
If you are uncertain about how to cite a particular
potential, don't hesitate to contact me.
Also, if you are worried that your potential files have become corrupted,
contact me for fresh ones.
